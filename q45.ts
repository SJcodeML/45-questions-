// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model 
// name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-
// value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.




function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, options: { [key: string]: any }): object {
    const car: { [key: string]: any } =
    {
        manufacturer:manufacturer,
        model:model,
        ...options
    }
                  
          
    return car;
}

// Call the function with required information and additional properties
const myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Camry",  { color: "blue", year:["2022", 45] });

// Print the returned object
console.log(myCar);
