// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name 
// and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries
//  representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional 
//  parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number 
//  of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.

// In TypeScript, a class is a blueprint for creating 
// objects with specific properties and methods. It serves as a template to define the structure and behavior of objects.
