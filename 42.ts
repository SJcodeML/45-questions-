// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the 
// array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.



function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    const greatMagicians: string[] = [];
    for (let magician of magicians) {
        greatMagicians.push(`The Great ${magician}`);
    }
    return greatMagicians;
}

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (let magician of magicians) {
        console.log(magician);
    }
}

// Example usage:
const magicians: string[] = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Penn Jillette", "Teller"];
const greatMagicians: string[] = make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(greatMagicians);
