// Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array, 
// and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
// • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza. 
// For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.

// • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza. 
// The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!
